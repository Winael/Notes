It's pretty hard to beat getting featured in Popular Science, but this week we somehow managed to have even bigger news! A new advisor, open sourcing a project, and continued advancement of the Mycroft hardware - so many awesome things to talk about! So let's get started!

We were happy to add Jono Bacon as an advisor to Mycroft AI. Jono is the community manager at GitHub, served as former community manager at Canonical and XPrize, and is the author of "The Art of Community", "Linux Desktop Hacks" and "PHP and MySQL Web Applications". Jono was an early supported of the Mycroft project, posting online promoting our Kickstarter and we are very grateful to him for that. Jono is a prominent leader in the open source world and we are lucky to have him on board. [(Click here to find out more)][1]

The software team has decided to release our first open source module. The Adapt Engine is the portion of the Mycroft stack that parses user intent. It understands that "Turn the light in the living room on" means: action "turn on", location "living room", object "light". It then selects a skill and takes action. The Adapt Engine was the brainchild of Lead Software Engineer Sean Fitzgerald, and has gone a long way to accelerating the project in an amazing direction. We expect to release this module before Jan 15, 2016.

The hardware team has continued work on our final design. This week we finished demo board designs for Mycroft's RGB LED eye rings and display matrix. These are off at the PCB printer and will be ready to integrate in the next week or so. Click [here][2] and [here][3] to see pictures. We will share more in the coming weeks as the final design comes together.

Thanks to all our fans and backers who continue to support us, we love you guys so much! Also, for those of you who have not purchased a Mycroft unit yet, the deadline is December 31, 2015! So if you, a family member, or friend have not ordered yet and wants one - do it now! [You can preorder here!][4]
